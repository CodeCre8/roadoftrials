      <h3>My Road of Trials</h3>
      <h1>FRED</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="intro">
      <p>I am taking the Frontend Developer Career Path course on Scrimba and have decided to keep track of my progress.</p>
      <p>This website is where I upload the projects I build while learning. After having gone through other courses for learning web development, I have found that the transistion from following lessons and doing it on your own is quite challenging.</p>
      <p>Learning from my past experience, I have decided to try a new approach. I will build a "before" version of the projects. Then at the completion of the course to go back and "refactor" the visual presentation and the code for the "after" version.</p>
      <p>The goal is to keep the momentum of progression without sacrificing the learning from building on my own and getting bogged down by overt ambition at every stage of the course.</p>
