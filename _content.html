I am the programmer of my life, I code happiness that sticks and debug mistakes that suck.
This site is where I capture milestones that recharge me and things that motivate me on this stretch of journey in the remaining 2020.

Symbols
Phoenix
From spirit: Freedom from suffering, past karma, and reincarnation. The phoneix represents the transformation of the past. It doesn't mean running from it, denying it, or burning bridges with 
rage. The phoneix employs an advanced technique described in your guts as the burning of impurities through practice and dedication. The essence of the phoneix is with us when we realize we have been suffering too long and something must change. We take a stand and decide to live consciously instead of driven by the unconscious mind and its long list of fears and over aversions. At that very moment the spark of the phoneix is lit, and the great bird burn helps us burn through our baggage. We no longer run from who we are and what has happened to us or what we have done. The stuckness and dead weight fall into the ashes. As the lightness and clarity emerges as the stagnancy continues to smolder, the phoneix lifts our spirits up and up. We begin to recognize ourselves again. We might catch a glimmer in our eyes that wasn't there before and look closely it is a sign the fire of transformation is upon your wings of phoneix. The first chakra the ancient yogi believes that our heaviest karmas reside in the first chakra that this earthen center is also called muladhara or our root, and the accent of the phoneix begins here. As entitlement of karmas is slowly burned, it rises from the ash toward the naval center again and again. It makes the journey from the first to the third chakra purifying our essence and freeing us from the past so the phoneix rising above the ashes.

Vulture
This guardian and purifier is essential for rebalance. The vulture is perhaps the most misunderstood creature of all. This intriguing bird balances our ecosystem and prevents the spread of disease. It does the dirty work that no one else wants to do and cleans up our messes. The vulture appears that there is a situation that need to be purified or brought back into balance. Remember the vulture is greatly unvalued what you thought was a mistake or tradegy is a blessing in disguise. When in balance you are, you clarify, you reveal widom. When you are not, you are dramatic and aggressive. To be back in balance, clear your speech, space, and sage.
