About Site

Quote: The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the second best is now. â€“ Chinese Proverb
This site is where I capture things that guide, recharge, and  motivate me on this journey of renewal. 
Code Happiness that sticks.


I create this site to capture the things that I see and make on this journey in order to give me the fuel to keep moving and energy to stay positive.

The time of writing is the beginning of September. Events big and small are taking place and repidly transforming the world. Regarding the uncertainy of the road ahead, my guess is that I am hardly the only one in feeling disoriented. Freaked out at times I feel at risk of being overcome by fears as new normals are taking shapes in real time, and I remain fixed. To keep fear out, I need to act.

I need to I am going to get things done and also stop doing certain things between the time . My goal is that when I greet the new world in 2021. 

The idea of building this site started with the hope of recording my failures and accomplishments during 

Historical events don't repeat, but they do rhyme. In the early 20th century, WWI, 1918 Pandemic, and the Great Depression happend and laid the groundwork for the world order we know now. A century later in 2020, the world is at a point again when undeniable forces meet immovable objects.
