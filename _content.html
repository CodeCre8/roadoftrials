About Site

Historical events don't repeat, but they do rhyme. In the early 20th century, WWI, 1918 Pandemic, and the Great Depression happend and laid the groundwork for the world order we know now. A century later in 2020, the world is at a point again when undeniable forces meet immovable objects.

Events are repidly transforming the world. My guess is that I am hardly alone in feeling disoriented regarding the uncertainy of the road ahead. Freaked out at times, I feel at risk of being overcome by fears as new normals are taking shapes in real time. To keep fear out, I need to act. 

I create this site to capture the things that I see and make on this journey in order to give me the fuel to keep moving and energy to stay positive.
